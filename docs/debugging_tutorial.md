Ok, thanks.  That's working.  The assumption was that the structure of the conference web pages had not changed and so we completely missed the problem by using the wrong heuristic.  A better approach would have been to set up a debug session and step through the code to confirm or deny that initial heuristic.  Agree?  If so, can you give me a short tutorial on setting up a debug session in vs code on codespaces?

You're **exactly right.**  
Really good reflection. Let's spell it out:

---

‚úÖ **What went wrong?**

- **Initial heuristic:** "If we find a `<dl>` and inside that `<dt>` + `<dd>`, assume they match correctly."
- **Reality:** In the new page structure, **different sections** like 'Presenter/Authors' and 'Abstract' **are in different `<dl>` blocks** ‚Äî not bundled under a single `<dl>`.
- **Symptom:** No matching Abstract because we exited too early after looking in the wrong place.

‚úÖ **Better troubleshooting approach:**

- Instead of trying to "fix" based only on assumptions + printed HTML,
- üî• **You should set a breakpoint and step through** *live*:
    - Look at what `soup.find('dl')` is actually returning.
    - See how many `<dl>` blocks exist.
    - Confirm how `<dt>` / `<dd>` pairs are organized.

# üéØ Quick Tutorial: Debugging Python in VS Code Codespaces

You're very close to using Codespaces to *step through live* ‚Äì here's the **simple way**:

---

## Step 1: Open your Codespace + Install the Python extension (if not already)

‚úÖ Inside your Codespace:
- Open **Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Search for: **"Python: Select Interpreter"**
- Make sure you're using your `.venv` virtual environment.
- **Ensure** the **Python extension** is installed (you'll see Python-specific highlighting).

---

## Step 2: Add a breakpoint

‚úÖ In your `aacr_scraper.py` or wherever the function is defined:
- Click in the **left gutter** next to the line number where you want to stop (you'll see a little red dot).
  
Example:  
Set a breakpoint at:

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, "html.parser")
```

Or even:

```python
dl_tag = soup.find("dl")
```

‚úÖ That way you can **inspect exactly** what BeautifulSoup is giving you!

---

## Step 3: Set up a simple launch config

‚úÖ Open `.vscode/launch.json` (create it if it doesn't exist).

Add this config:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: aacr_scraper",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/aacr_scraper.py",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "args": [
        "--test-get-abstracts",
        "--debug"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

‚úÖ This lets you **debug just 1 page** without running the whole `--build-all`.

(You can modify `"args"` later if you want full runs.)

---

## Step 4: Start the debugger

‚úÖ In VS Code:
- Open **Run & Debug** sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+D)
- Choose **"Python: aacr_scraper"** and hit **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Debugging**.

It'll launch your script and stop at your breakpoint!

---

## Step 5: Debug interactively

When it hits your breakpoint:
- Hover your mouse over variables to see their value
- Open the Debug Console (`Ctrl+Shift+Y`) and type:
  - `soup.prettify()`
  - `len(soup.find_all('dl'))`
  - `soup.find_all('dt')`
- **Step Over** (`F10`), **Step Into** (`F11`), **Continue** (`F5`) ‚Äî these are your main keys.

You can see exactly where your parsing assumption was wrong, *live*.

---

# üî• Why This Matters

The **only way to be sure** in web scraping is to **step inside the data**, because:

- Pages change without warning.
- Content may look fine in a browser but be differently structured in the DOM.
- Some parts might render late (JS async).

Debugging **one page at a time** early would have saved you hours.  
But now you know!

---

Would you like me to show you an even **faster debug method** too?  
(e.g., using a **small temp script** that just loads a single saved HTML dump and experiments on it?) üöÄ
This is *amazing* for scraping work.  
I can show you in like 5 lines if you want. üåü
