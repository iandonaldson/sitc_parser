https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0001	Background	Transarterial liver embolization (TAE), a minimally invasive procedure, has emerged as a pivotal treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), predominant form of primary liver cancer. This technique involves the delivery of embolic agents into the tumor-feeding blood vessels, selectively targeting the tumor. Given the role of hypoxia in establishing an immunosuppressive tumor environment (TME), characterizing the systemic and local immunological effects of TAE is essential for understanding hypoxia and immune response interactions to devise better combinatorial treatments aimed at reducing tumor recurrence rates. Our study aims to elucidate the TME immune dynamics induced by TAE using ethiodized-oil and microspheres.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0001	Methods	Our HCC model was generated by implantation of McArdle RH7777 cells in the left hepatic lobe of Buffalo rats. Animals were randomized to undergo TAE using either ethiodized-oil, unloaded microspheres (70-150 µm), or saline injection. Untreated tumors were included as controls. Blood samples were collected at baseline and post-TAE. Tumor samples were collected at 7 or 14 days after the intervention. Serum samples were analyzed using a rat cytokine/chemokine assay. CD45+ cells were isolated from the tumors by immunomagnetic cell separation followed by spectral flow cytometry and nanoString nCounter-custom-CodeSet analysis.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0001	Results	Our study reveals distinct immune signatures following TAE when comparing ethiodized-oil, microspheres, and untreated tumors. TAE with ethiodized-oil reduced serum levels of Th2-associated cytokines (IL-4,IL-5,IL-10,Eotaxin,IL-13, and IL-17A; P≤0.05), indicating diminished pro-tumoral responses post-treatment compared to baseline. Elevated levels of IL-18,IL-12, and IP-10 were also observed in a time-dependent manner in the ethiodized-oil-treated group (P≤0.05). Additionally, there was a notable decrease in IL-1α/β,TNFα,G-CSF,CCL5, and MCP-1 (P≤0.05), suggesting a pronounced Th1-type systemic response. Results from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis supported these findings, showing the downregulation of Th2-related chemokine receptors, STAT6 and GATA3 master regulators, critical in Th2 cell function/recruitment. Conversely, microspheres exhibited opposite trends compared to untreated tumors. Although no significant changes were found in T-cell helpers and dendritic cells between treatments, significant differences were noted in natural killer-like cells (P≤0.02), CD4+γ producing cells, and non-classical Tregulatory cells (CD25+FoxP3+PD1+), with the lowest levels in the ethiodized-oil group (P≤0.03). Notably, the ethiodized-oil group also had the lowest levels of exhausted CD8+ T cells after 14 days. No significant differences were observed between saline and untreated groups at any analyzed timepoints.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0001	Conclusions	Ethiodized-oil TAE potentially creates a less immunosuppressive TME than unloaded-bead embolization, possibly due to its milder hypoxic insult. This characteristic may render ethiodized-oil a more favorable therapeutic strategy for combined treatment approaches with immunotherapy.

https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0002	Background	We reported integrin β4 (ITGB4)-targeted immunologic strategies, e.g., ITGB4 protein-pulsed dendritic cell (ITGB4-DC) vaccine and adoptive transfer of anti-CD3/anti-ITGB4 bispecific antibody-armed tumor-draining lymph node T cells. Both immunotherapies demonstrated significant efficacy in inhibiting local tumor growth and lung metastases in murine breast (4T1) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC7) tumor models. These therapeutic efficacies were associated with T cell as well as humoral anti-integrin β4highcancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, we report targeting integrin β1high/β3highCSCs while simultaneously blocking PD-L1.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0002	Methods	The expression of integrin subunits was assessed in murine melanoma cell lines F10 and D5 and in fresh mouse melanoma tumors. We generated integrin subunits β1 (ITGB1) and/or β3 (ITGB3)-pulsed DCs for vaccination and evaluated their antitumor efficacy either alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1 in targeting ALDHhighCSCsvs.ALDHlownon-CSCs.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0002	Results	Integrin subunits β1 and β3 are both expressed in cultured F10 and D5 melanoma cells (figure 1), and in newly harvested fresh melanoma tumors (figure 2). The expression of ITGB1 and ITGB3 on F10 and D5 ALDHhighCSCs (83.3% and 87.1% respectively) are higher than their expression on ALDHlowF10 non-CSCs (0.2%) and ALDHlowD5 non-CSCs (2.0%) (figures 3-5), suggesting that ITGB1 and ITGB3-targeted vaccine is directed towards the ITGB1high/ITGB3highmelanoma CSCs. ITGB1 and/or ITGB3-pulsed DC vaccine in F10 model demonstrated that ITGB1-DC or ITGB3-DC vaccine each exhibited significant antitumor efficacy, and ITGB1-DC + ITGB3-DC dual vaccine showed an additive/synergistic anti-tumor effect. ITGB1 and ITGB3 loaded on separate DCs demonstrated more potent antitumor efficacy than those loaded on the same DC (figure 6). Anti-PD-L1 augmented the antitumor efficacy of ITGB1-DC/ITGB3-DC vaccine (figure 7). Recent studies suggested that bone marrow (BM)-DCs expressing dysfunctional integrin β2 (ITGB2) exhibited more potent antigen presentation function than WT BM-DCs. We found that ITGB2 highly expressed on the surface of BM-DC (63.3%), but not on F10 or D5 tumor cells. On-going experiments to verify that ITGB1 and ITGB3-targeted vaccines have reduced the number and function of ITGB1high/ITGB3highmelanoma CSCsviaboth cellular and humoral mechanisms, and the generation and use of ITGB2 knock-down DCs for the vaccine preparation to improve the efficacy of DC vaccine targeting ITGB1high/ITGB3highmelanoma CSCs warrant further investigation.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0002	Conclusions	ITGB1-DC or ITGB3-DC vaccine alone each exhibited significant antitumor efficacy, and ITGB1-DC + ITGB3-DC showed additive/synergistic anti-tumor effect. ITGB1 and ITGB3 loaded on separate DCs demonstrated more potent antitumor efficacy than those loaded on the same DCs for vaccination, and anti-PD-L1 significantly augmented such antitumor efficacy.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointAbstract 2 Figure 1The expression of β integrin subunits in mice melanoma cell lines (F10 and D5)Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointAbstract 2 Figure 2Elevated expression of ITGB1 and ITGB3 in freshly harvested mouse melanoma tumorsDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointAbstract 2 Figure 3Expression of ITGB2 on the surface of BMDCDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointAbstract 2 Figure 4Expression of ITGB1 and ITGB3 in melanoma cancer stem cells vs. non cancer stem cellsDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointAbstract 2 Figure 5Multiple staining shows ITGB1 and ITGB3 expressed on the same melanoma cellDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointAbstract 2 Figure 6ITGB1 and ITGB3 loaded on separate DCs demonstrated more potent antitumor efficacyDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointAbstract 2 Figure 7Integrin-pulsed DC vaccine inhibits F10 mouse tumor growth, anti-PD-L1 significantly augmented the antitumor efficacy
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0003	Background	The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in a wide range of cancer types. HER2 amplification and overexpression occur in 25% to 30% of human breast cancer cases and are associated with poor prognosis. Humanized murine cancer cells facilitate the translation from preclinical to clinical studies by incorporating specific human genes into murine cancer cells. These humanized tumor models are instrumental in the preclinical evaluation of antibody drugs. In this study, the mouse HER2 gene was replaced with the human HER2 coding sequence in B-hHER2 CT26.WT cells and B-hHER2 MC38 cells. Several HER2-targeting antibody drugs and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, DS8201, and RC48, have been approved worldwide for patients with HER2-positive tumors. Specific humanized tumor cell lines overexpressing tumor-associated antigens are valuable for assessing the efficacy of antibody drugs and ADCs.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0003	Methods	The B-hHER2 MC38 plus and B-hHER2 CT26.WT murine colon cancer cell lines were developed by replacing the mouse HER2 gene with the human HER2 gene in the C57BL/6 MC38 cell line and the BALB/c CT26.WT cell line, respectively. Human HER2 protein expression on these cell lines was detected by flow cytometry. The in vivo tumor growth potential of B-hHER2 MC38 plus and B-hHER2 CT26.WT cells was assessed in HER2 humanized mice (B-hHER2 mice) or BALB/c mice implanted with either tumor cell line. The tumor growth inhibition activity of two HER2 ADCs, Trastuzumab analog-MMAE (in-house) and DS8201 (purchased from Daiichi Sankyo), was evaluated in 4-1BB and HER2 double humanized B-h4-1BB/hHER2 mice inoculated with the B-hHER2 MC38 plus cell line. Additionally, the tumor growth inhibition activity of Trastuzumab analog-MMAE (in-house) was measured in BALB/c mice inoculated with the B-hHER2 CT26.WT cell line.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0003	Results	Both B-hHER2 MC38 plus and B-hHER2 CT26.WT cell lines demonstrated overexpression of the human HER2 protein, as confirmed by flow cytometry. These cell lines exhibited normal growth in B-hHER2 mice and BALB/c mice, respectively. In vivo, treatment with 10 mg/kg Trastuzumab analog-MMAE and 5 mg/kg DS8201 completely inhibited the growth of the B-hHER2 MC38 plus cell line. Additionally, 10 mg/kg Trastuzumab analog-MMAE significantly inhibited the growth of the B-hHER2 CT26.WT cell line in vivo.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0003	Conclusions	Both HER2-humanized murine cancer cell lines, B-hHER2 MC38 plus and B-hHER2 CT26.WT, successfully form syngeneic mouse tumor models suitable for in vivo pharmacodynamic evaluation of HER2 ADCs.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0004	Background	Bystander killing is an important phenomenon in ADC therapeutics. Current bystander killing evaluation experiments often involve mixing two different tumor cells with positive or negative tumor specific targets, however tumors in patients typically contain the same type of tumor cells with varying expression levels of specific targets. To address this issue, we genetically edited a TROP2-positive non-fluorescent tumor cell line into a TROP2 knocked out fluorescent tumor cell line. The treatments of ADC drug candidates on the mixtures of these two kinds of cells can facilitate the analysis of how ADC drugs respond to heterogenous tumors with varying ratios of same-type tumor target positive cells to bystander tumor cells.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0004	Methods	The full-length coding sequence of human TROP2 in human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 was replaced with luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) to generate the B-Luc-GFP KI, TROP2 KO BxPC-3 tumor cell line. To validate the fluorescence of this tumor cell model, Bright-Glo™ luciferase assay and flow cytometry were used to detect the luciferase and GFP reporters, respectively. To confirm the human TROP2 knock-out in this cell model, the expression of human TROP2 was analyzed by flow cytometry. To evaluate thein vitrobystander killing effect of the TROP2-ADC drug, B-Luc-GFP KI, TROP2 KO BxPC-3 and BxPC-3 cells were co-cultured at ratios of 1:1, 1:0, and 0:1, and treated with the TROP2-ADC drug candidate for 3 days. Adherent cells were collected and counted by flow cytometry. To evaluate thein vivobystander killing effect of the TROP2-ADC drug, cell-derived xenograft (CDX) model was established by inoculating B-Luc-GFP KI, TROP2 KO BxPC-3 and BxPC-3 cells at a specific ratio into immunodeficient mice, and tumor volumes post treatment were recorded by direct measurement and luminal signal.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0004	Results	Human TROP2 protein was not detected, but a strong luminescence signal and the GFP fluorescence were detected in B-Luc-GFP KI, TROP2 KO BxPC-3 cells. The targeted killing of TROP2-positive BxPC-3 cells and the bystander killing of TROP2-negative B-Luc-GFP KI, TROP2 KO BxPC-3 cells by TROP2-ADC treatment were observed bothin vitroandin vivo.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0004	Conclusions	Our data demonstrates that the B-Luc-GFP KI, TROP2 KO BxPC-3 cell model is a reliable tool for the preclinical evaluation of the bystander killing effect of candidate ADC therapeutic drugs, bothin vitroandin vivo.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0005	Background	Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1, have transformed cancer therapy in the last decade. Yet, questions persist regarding their efficacy and pose ongoing challenges. Identifying more robust biomarkers is crucial in immuno-oncology, and the iterative process between in silico discovery and experimental studies emphasizes the discovery of the most suitable therapies for patients. Our aim was to pinpoint druggable, predictive biomarkers of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors by leveraging publicly available transcriptomic and clinical data.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0005	Methods	We set up an online analysis platform (https://rocplot.com/immune) with 1,434 samples from distinct tumor types1 2and selected best candidate genes overexpressed in non-responding patients for further investigations using in vitro and in vivo techniques.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0005	Results	Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP1) was the top druggable target overexpressed in non-responding patients (ROC AUC=0.699, FC=1.8, Mann-Whitney P=1.1E-08, PROC=7.5E-11) in the anti-PD-1 melanoma pre-treatment cohort (n=415). Patients with higher YAP1 expression experienced worse progression-free survival (HR=2.51, P=1.2E-06, log-rank test) and overall survival (HR=2.15, P=1.2E-05, log-rank test). We hypothesised that YAP1 inhibition with the FDA-approved drug Verteporfin (VP) could potentiate the effects of anti-PD-1 in melanoma. We found that VP significantly inhibited melanoma cell viability after 24 hours at 5 μM (P<0.0001) and 10 μM (P=0.0147) concentrations, while longer incubation periods (48 hours) showed efficacy with 0.1 μM (P=0.0014) and 1 μM (P=0.0004) concentrations. Next, we injected C57BL/6JRj mice with immunologically ‘cold’ B16-F10 and YUMM1.7 melanoma cell lines and treated them with VP, anti-PD1, the combination of both, or an IgG2a isotype control. In comparison to anti-PD-1 monotherapy (P=0.008), or control (P=0.021) groups, the combination of VP with anti-PD-1 demonstrated greater efficiency in reducing tumor size. We found increased macrophage and T cell infiltration in the combination therapy group based on elevated CD80, CD86, CD68, and CD45 expression levels. Neither Verteporfin alone nor anti-PD-1 alone exhibited significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to the control (P=0.425 and P=0.971, respectively). No notable difference was observed among the cohorts in B16-F10 mice.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0005	Conclusions	To sum up, a database was set up for the discovery of immunotherapy biomarkers, and a druggable predictive biomarker (YAP1) was chosen forin vitro, andin vivovalidation. Verteporfin, an inhibitor of YAP1, exhibited higher efficacy in treating melanoma in mice, either as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with anti-PD-1, outperforming both anti-PD-1 monotherapy and the control group.

https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0006	Background	Interleukin 12 (IL12), a heterodimer cytokine composed of IL12A (p35) and IL12B (p40), is mainly produced by dendritic cells and macrophages in response to antigenic stimulation. The receptor of IL-12 is a protein complex encoded by interleukin 12 receptor beta 1 (IL12Rβ1) and beta 2 (IL12Rβ2) genes. IL12 is a major regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity. It induces the proliferation and activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, stimulates the production of interferon (IFN)-γ, and promotes the differentiation and production of Th1-associated immunoglobulins. IL12 is a promising anti-tumor drug capable of transforming the tumor microenvironment from ‘cold’ to ‘hot’. However, unmodified IL12 may be ineffective and can cause severe immune-related adverse effects. Modified IL12 or its combination with other therapeutic agents may enhance efficacy and overcome safety challenges.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0006	Methods	A novel mouse model with knock-in (KI) of human IL12RB1 and IL12RB2 genes, named B-hIL12RB1/hIL12RB2 mice ad, was generated by crossing independently developed IL12RB1 and IL12RB2 single KI mice. To validate the functionality of the humanized IL12Rβ1 and IL12Rβ2 receptor complex, CD4+T cells sorted from splenocytes of C57BL/6 and homozygous B-hIL12RB1/hIL12RB2 mice ad were stimulated with human IL-12in vitro, and IFN-γ production was detected by ELISA. To evaluate thein-vivotoxicity of human IL-12 analogs, B-hIL12RB1/hIL12RB2 mice ad were treated with human IL12 daily for 3 days. Body weight was measured daily during treatment. Liver and spleen weights were measured at the endpoint of the experiment. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels in mouse serum were measured by ELISA 6-hour and 24-hour post last treatment.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0006	Results	Human IL12 induced the IFN-γ production by CD4+T cells from homozygous B-hIL12RB1/hIL12RB2 mice ad, but not C57BL/6 mice. In thein-vivotoxicity study, human IL12 treatment increased the ratios of liver weight to body weight and spleen weight to body weight, as well as exhibited a tendency towards increased AST activity in B-hIL12RB1/hIL12RB2 mice ad.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0006	Conclusions	The humanization of the IL12RB1 and IL12RB2 genes was successful in B-hIL12RB1/hIL12RB2 mice ad, enabling evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of human IL12 analogs.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0007	Background	Compared to normal cells or their corresponding tissues, CD200 is overexpressed in various cancers such as kidney cancer, head and neck cancer, and colon cancer. The upregulation of CD200 on various human cancer cells has an immunosuppressive effect on immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, creating conditions that favor tumor development, growth, and spread. This indicates that CD200 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic factor for a range of malignant tumors.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0007	Methods	To evaluate the preclinical efficacy of therapies targeting CD200 or CD200R, we developed a human CD200 and CD200R in situ knock-in (B-hCD200/hCD200R) mouse model and a human CD200 in situ knock-in (B-hCD200 MC38) murine colon cancer cell line. We used flow cytometry to assess the protein expression of CD200 and CD200R in B-hCD200/hCD200R mice, as well as the CD200 protein expression on B-hCD200 MC38 cells. We established a syngeneic mouse model by inoculating B-hCD200 MC38 cells into B-hCD200/hCD200R mice and measured the tumor growth curve. Our collaborative client evaluated the pharmacodynamics of an anti-human CD200 antibody combined with an anti-mouse PD-1 antibody in this model.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0007	Results	We confirmed the expression of human CD200 and CD200R proteins in B-hCD200/hCD200R mice, as well as high levels of human CD200 protein expression in B-hCD200 MC38 cells. In vivo tumor growth was comparable between B-hCD200 MC38 and wild-type MC38 cells in B-hCD200/hCD200R mice. The combination of an anti-human CD200 antibody and an anti-mouse PD-1 antibody effectively inhibited the growth of B-hCD200 MC38 tumors in B-hCD200/hCD200R mice.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0007	Conclusions	B-hCD200/hCD200R mice and B-hCD200 MC38 cells can be paired to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of anti-human CD200 antibodies and immune checkpoint drugs.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0008	Background	The KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase(KRAS)harbors the most frequent oncogenic mutations in human cancers and serves as an important biomarker in the treatment of lung cancer. Meanwhile, mutations inLiver kinase B1(LKB1),also known asSTK11, are found in 17–23% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. TheLKB1 mutations typically result in loss of function and frequently co-occur withKRASmutations, collectively contributing to resistance of NSCLC to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies. Therefore, while ICI therapy has been approved for treating non-small cell lung cancer, strategies to enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy (CIT) remain to be explored. Inhibitors targetingKRASmutations represent another promising therapeutic option forKRAS-mutant NSCLC. Several studies have demonstrated that inhibition of mutantKRASeffectively reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhances tumor sensitivity to ICIs through diverse mechanisms. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing new preclinical models with competent immune systems to efficiently assess the efficacy of tested drugs and ICIs onKRASandLKBdouble mutant NSCLC tumors.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0008	Methods	We engineered mice in C57BL/6 background with the KRAS(G12D) mutation, LKB deficiency, and expression of firefly luciferase, resulting in spontaneous non-small cell lung cancer tumors. We named this spontaneously arising tumor cell line the KLL cell line.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0008	Results	The KLL cell line can be used for subcutaneous and orthotopic lung tumor transplantation in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice to establish syngeneic tumor models. Compared to the commonly used LLC2 mouse lung cancer cell line, the KLL syngeneic model exhibits a distinct immune profile, demonstrating different responses toKRASmutation inhibitors and ICIs, while effectively simulating complex tumor microenvironments.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0008	Conclusions	We established a new syngeneic preclinical model of lung cancer with dual mutations inKRASandLKB, which can assist scientists in studying optimal treatment strategies for NSCLC, particularly the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0009	Background	Humanized mice are specialized animal models that are used to assess the efficacy of human immunotherapies on tumors. Humanized mice incorporate components of the human immune system and are created by injecting human CD34+hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into an immunodeficient mouse. PBMC humanized (HuPBMC) mice recapitulate a robust human T cell population. One challenge when using HuPBMC mice is the onset of graft versus host disease (GvHD), limiting their lifespan compared to hCD34+HSC humanized mice. The development of xenogeneic GvHD is dependent on the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on host cells and lowering MHC expression can delay the onset of GvHD.We examine two mouse strains, the NCG-B2m-KO and NCG-MHC-dKO, to determine the effects of MHC expression on GvHD. NCG-B2m-KO mice lack beta-2 microglobulin, a component of MHC I, and have lower cell surface expression of MHC I molecules. NCG-MHC-dKO mice lack the expression of MHC I and MHC II molecules.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0009	Methods	We compared the onset of GvHD and human immune cell engraftment rates between HuPBMC NCG-MHC-dKO mice, HuPBMC NCG-B2m-KO mice and HuPBMC NCG mice. Mice were injected with 1x107PBMCs from individual donors. Animals were weighed three times a week to monitor for changes in body weight and general health status. Peripheral blood was collected at day 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 90 post injection for flow cytometric screening of human immune cell engraftment (hCD45+, hCD3+, hCD4+and hCD8+). PBMC donor variability was also compared between these three PBMC humanized models by evaluating multiple donors and assessing additional collections from the same donor. HuPBMC mice were injected with RKO human colon carcinoma cells and tumor kinetics were compared between groups.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0009	Results	Increased survival was observed in the HuPBMC NCG-MHC-dKO mice compared to the NCG-B2m-KO mice. Both HuPBMC NCG-MHC-dKO mice and NCG-B2m-KO mice survived longer than HuPBMC NCG mice. Lower levels of engraftment were observed in both the HuPBMC NCG-MHC-dKO mice and HuPBMC NCG-B2m-KO mice compared to HuPBMC NCG mice.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0009	Conclusions	HuPBMC models have limited study duration due to the onset of GvHD. The deficiency of MHC delays the onset of GvHD allowing for the potential use in longer term tumor studies before the results are confounded by GvHD. PBMC humanized mice are an important model for translational research using immunotherapies and the PBMC humanized NCG-MHC-dKO and NCG-B2m-KO models provide an expanded study window ideal for oncology studies.

https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0010	Background	Syngeneic mouse models serve as invaluable tools in preclinical immunotherapy research. By implanting cancer cells into immunocompetent mice, tumor-immune interactions and therapeutic responses can be assessed in a physiologically relevant setting. Here, we investigated the feasibility and utility of using immune gene expression (iGEX)-based biomarkers to differentiate variable responses to immunotherapy in different syngeneic mouse models.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0010	Methods	Our study included 19 models covering 10 different cancers. Tumor fragments were taken from treatment naïve tumors of representative mice from each model and subjected to whole-transcriptome sequencing. Data for immune-related genes were extracted and normalized to gene expression ranks for analysis. Previously validated iGEX signatures for monitoring the tumor immune microenvironment were calculated including signatures for tumor immunogenicity (TIGS), cellular proliferation (CP), and cancer testis antigen burden (CTAB).1 2Models were considered to have high expression for an immune gene or signature if gene expression rank was >50. Expression data was paired with tumor growth data from 1,839 mice treated with 1 of 8 different treatments to test if iGEX-based biomarkers associated with response to treatment. Survival analysis using mixed effects Cox regression was performed to test associations with treatment response. Tumor growth to 2,000 mm3was considered the end point for survival analysis.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0010	Results	Three significant associations were detected between iGEX signatures and experimental outcomes (figure 1A), two involving TIGS, which reflects immune cell activation. Models with high TIGS were found to have faster tumor growth than those with low TIGS (figure 1B) and were found to have reduced response to anti-CD137 (figure 1C). Out of 85 tested immune genes, high expression of 39 were associated with reduced response to at least one treatment, while high expression of 13 were associated with better response to at least one treatment (figure 2A). The strongest positive associations were seen forGm5751(ortholog ofSSXgenes in human), where high expressing models had better response to TNF receptor-based agonists (anti-CD137, -GITR, -OX40) (figure 2B-E).

https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0011	Background	Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a novel cancer therapy based on a monoclonal antibody conjugated with a photosensitizer (IR700Dye) that is activated by near-infrared light. When exposed to light irradiation, IR700Dye undergoes photochemical ligand reactions, releasing hydrophilic side chains. This chemical transformation damages the cell membrane of targeted cancer cells, leading to necrotic cell death. Furthermore, NIR-PIT rapidly induces immunogenic cell death, thereby triggering the activation of the adaptive immune response through dead cell-associated antigens.In this study, we examined the efficacy of NIR-PIT utilizing a small protein mimetic (Affibody, 6–7 kDa) in lieu of a monoclonal antibody for addressing brain metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancer. Due to its compact size, the Affibody demonstrates efficient penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) when the BBB is partially disrupted. Our innovative NIR-PIT system has the potential to target brain metastasis and eliciting an immune response within the brain.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0011	Methods	In the in vitro study, we employed the HER2-positive breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB361), which is derived from brain metastases, alongside the HER2-negative cell line (MDA-MB231). Cell viability was assessed to gauge the impact of NIR-PIT. For the in vivo investigation, MDA-MB361 cells were injected into the brain of mice (BALB/cSlc-nu/nu) to establish a brain metastasis model. Two weeks after cell injection, the HER2 Affibody-IR700Dye conjugate was injected into the tail vein. Subsequently, the brain was monitored fluorescence intensity, and the brain tumors were irradiated with near-infrared light. The brain tissues were observed using fluorescence microscopy, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of microglial cells and HER2 protein.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0011	Results	MDA-MB361 cells exhibited stronger fluorescent signals of IR700Dye (figure 1). Upon measuring cell viability, only MDA-MB361 cells exposed to NIR-PIT with the HER2 Affibody-IR700Dye conjugate maintained low viability (figure 2).The fluorescence intensity in the head experienced a significant surge immediately following the administration of the HER2 Affibody-IR700Dye conjugate. Within an hour after the injection, the HER2 Affibody-IR700Dye conjugate delineated the tumor mass. This observation aligned with HE staining of consecutive sections and IHC of HER2 protein (figure 3). Following NIR-PIT, HE staining revealed necrotic cell death within the brain tumor, with microglial cells localized inside the tumor mass (figure 4).
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0011	Conclusions	The proposed approach holds the potential for facilitating effective NIR-PIT for brain metastases in breast cancer.

https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0012	Background	Gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumors in adults and have shown little response to most immunotherapies. Deciphering the antigen repertoire in gliomas and the contribution of different antigen types is crucial to better understanding anti-tumor immunity and for the development of multi-antigen targeted immunotherapies. While neoantigens and developmental tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been widely studied, knowledge of antigens arising from tumor-enriched isoform-junction antigens (TIAs) remains limited. TIAs occur as a result of protein junction sequence generated from aberrant splicing patterns unique or enriched within tumor cells compared with normal tissue. Herein, we implemented a multi-omics approach to evaluate the contribution of TIAs to the antigen pool in gliomas, their immunologic characteristics in relation to other antigens, their presence in immunopeptidomics data and their impact on glioma patient survival and response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0012	Methods	We obtained transcriptomic samples from TCGA and CCGA databases. Neoantigens and TAAs were predicted using established bioinformatic prediction tools. TIAs were predicted based on isoform switches from the normal brain to the tumor, their relationship with normal tissues, and single-cell RNAseq data to evaluate specificity. HLA class I distribution was determined across samples to predict HLA-restricted antigen epitopes. Sequences specific to or enriched within gliomas were used as input into NetMHCpan and NetCTLpan for epitope prediction. Immunopeptidome data were matched with the predicted epitopes. Survival associations were determined using regression models and Kaplan-Meier plots using the above datasets and published paired pre-/post-PD1 treatment glioma RNA-seq data.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0012	Results	Analysis of multi-omics data predicted neoantigen and TAA epitopes from 54,671 missense mutations, 368 TAAs and 276 TIAs. TIAs were most broadly shared across patients and demonstrated the highest expression and strongest affinity HLA-binding epitopes. Additionally, TIAs showed features of antigenicity resembling neoantigens and were frequently presented on MHC molecules in glioma immunopeptidomics data. Patients with more epitopes of high expression and high predicted MHC-binding affinity demonstrated worse survival outcome regardless of tumor grade or IDH status. Additionally, in a pre-/post-anti-PD1 glioma cohort, the number of these epitopes, consisting only of TIAs, decreased in immunotherapy responders, and increased in non-responders.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0012	Conclusions	Our data highlights the potential and promising characteristics of understudied TIAs as immunotherapy targets for gliomas.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0014	Background	Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a cytokine that plays a major role in activating cellular immunity and promoting anti-tumor immune response. Monitoring the level of IFN-γ has become the industrial standard for evaluation of the efficacy of immunotherapy drugs. However, widely used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is not only costly and time-consuming, but also often fails to detect the low level IFN-γ in the early-stage immune activation. Moreover, it is difficult to correctly quantify the paracrine signaling of IFN-γ secreted by T cells in recently popularized 3D co-culture models using ELISA. A novel approach to fulfill the rapidly expanding need of assessing immunotherapy drug candidates and more effective monitoring of immune activation for cancer immunotherapy studies is urgently needed.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0014	Methods	We engineered three reporter cancer cell lines that contain a gamma interferon activation site (GAS)-response element upstream of luciferase gene. In response to IFN-γ receptor binding and subsequent signaling activation, these cells express luciferase, which can be readily detected and quantified to evaluate the level of immune activation. The cell lines were selected for their endogenous expression of immune checkpoint ligands, PD-L1, CD155, or B7-H3, based on a comprehensive protein profiling. The established reporter cells were stimulated with various concentrations of IFN-γ, incubated with conditioned media from primary T cells, or co-cultured with IFN-γ-producing immune cells in the presence of immune checkpoint inhibitors followed by a luciferase assay to evaluate the system. Then the reporter cells were 2D or 3D co-cultured with primary T cells after which the cells were harvested for luciferase assay and the conditioned media were collected for IFN-γ ELISA for direct comparison of the two assays.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0014	Results	Our data showed that the bioluminescence intensity from the reporter cells increased approximately 100-250 folds in a dose-dependent manner in response to IFN-γ stimulation. It increased approximately 50-100 folds in response to primary T cell-conditioned media stimulation. In co-culture assays with primary T cells or NK cells in the presence of corresponding immune checkpoint inhibitors, these reporter cell lines demonstrated 3-12-fold increase in bioluminescence intensity. In comparison to ELISA in 2D and 3D co-culture systems, the reporter cells produced robust luminescence signal even when IFN-γ concentrations fell below the assay range of conventional ELISA.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0014	Conclusions	These GAS-Luc2 reporter cell lines demonstrated exceptional assay sensitivity and adaptability in detection of IFN-γ in 2D and 3D cultures. They provide an excellent tool for early-stage monitoring of immune activation and convenient and sensitive evaluation of immunotherapy drugs.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0016	Background	The presence of tumor-localized tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) has been increasingly shown to correlate with improved survival in certain solid tumor types.1-3There is an unmet need to generate TLSs in tumors of patients where their absence is noted, with the intent to potentially improve outcomes. To address this, we employed murine models and hypothesized that encapsulating lymphoid chemokines and cytokines in controlled-release biomaterials would allow for their sustained delivery to the local tissue microenvironment, promote immune T cell and B cell accumulation, and lead to thein situformation of TLS-like structures.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0016	Methods	We encapsulated mouse homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily cytokine lymphotoxin-alpha1/beta2 in lipid-enveloped mesoporous microparticles.In vitrocharacterization studies were performed to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency, release kinetics by ELISA, and chemotactic index of encapsulated chemokines by transwell assay. Chemokine/cytokine-releasing microparticles were next embedded in a thermosensitive chitosan-based hydrogel and injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. At weeks 1-4 post-injection, hydrogels, along with any newly formed surrounding tissues, were excised for histological analysis via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and flow cytometry.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0016	Results	In vitrocharacterization studies indicated over 90% encapsulation efficiency for CCL19 in microparticles, with a sustained release profile where 78% of the chemokine was released over the first three days, as compared to levels measured on day seven. Additionally, chemotaxis experiments confirmed that all three chemokines—CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13—retained their functional capacity to trigger lymphoid cell migration after being released from microparticles. Subcutaneous injections of chemokine/cytokine-releasing microparticles embedded in chitosan hydrogel led to thein vivoformation of structures enriched with immune cell aggregates, exhibiting more than a 10-fold increase in the number of CD45+immune cells (p < 0.0001) within the newly formed structures surrounding the residual hydrogel deposit. This was accompanied by a marked increase in the number of CD19+B cells (p < 0.0001) and CD3+T cells (p < 0.0001), with 55% and 22% of CD45+cells, respectively.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0016	Conclusions	We have developed an injectable biopolymer scaffold delivery system that can induce the formation of lymphoid aggregates resembling TLSs in mice. Given the importance of TLSs as reservoirs for tumor-infiltrating B and T lymphocytes and their established prognostic and predictive significance in certain human cancers, engineering such structures could serve as a vital platform for generatingin situanti-tumor immune responses, and thereby potentially enhancing the clinical efficacy of immunotherapies.

https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0017	Background	Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) induce robust efficacy by endogenous T cells in hematological malignancies, but their long-term efficacy is still insufficient in most cases. Currently available BsAbs provide only anti-CD3 antibody-mediated T-cell stimulation. Optimal T cell activation requires the simultaneous input of multiple signals, including costimulation and cytokine signaling.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0017	Methods	To overcome these limitations and simultaneously provide more comprehensive signals, we developed nano-sized cell-derived membrane vesicles (MVs) that orchestrate multimodal antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity in endogenous T cells. We genetically engineered the leukemia cell line K562 to express BsAbs, costimulatory ligands, cytokines, and immune checkpoint inhibitors on the cell surface. MVs with a size of 100-150 nm were generated by mechanical homogenization and isolation of plasma membrane fractions. The anti-tumor function of MVs loaded with various combinations of immunomodulatory factors was evaluated inin vitroandin vivoexperiments.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0017	Results	First, MVs were loaded with a membrane-bound form of the anti-CD3/CD19 BsAbs. These MVs induced potent cytotoxicity against the CD19-positive leukemia cell line NALM-6 in non-specific T cells in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of costimulatory ligands (CD80 and 4-1BBL) and cytokines (IL-7 and IL-15) resulted in superior T-cell proliferation and cytolytic function. T-cell activation was induced only in the presence of tumor cells expressing the target antigen, providing a safety advantage in the clinical setting. For thein vivoexperiment, NSG mice were transplanted with NALM-6 followed by intravenous injection of human T cells and MVs. Anti-CD19 MVs with CD80, 4-1BBL, IL-7 and IL-15 significantly suppressed leukemia progression.To overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), MVs were further loaded with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PDL1 antibody and anti-CTLA4 antibody), inflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and IL-18), and TGF-β receptors to trap TGF-β. Immunocompetent Balb/c mice were transplanted with the murine colon cancer cell line CT-26 expressing human CD19 and treated with anti-CD19 MVs. MVs converted immunosuppressive M2-type macrophages to pro-inflammatory phenotypes and induced cytotoxic CD8-positive T-cell infiltration into the TME, resulting in superior tumor control.Finally, MVs were loaded with BsAbs, 4-1BBL, IL-15, and IL-21 to activate NK cells. These MVs induced potent cytotoxic activity against the NK cell-resistant lymphoma cell line Raji in an antigen-specific manner.
https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2024-SITC2024.0017	Conclusions	Our novel technology induced therapeutic responses in both leukemia and solid tumor models by activating T cells. This platform can be used to target a broad range of cancers by activating various endogenous immune cells with the desired combinations of immunomodulatory signals.
